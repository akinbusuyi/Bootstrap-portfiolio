<!-- Some of your margin spacing were tight to the sides of the page. Pad some of the margins to have it fit nicely on the page. The footer spacing was not aligned with the Contact Me sitting lower than the links email, GitHub, etc. The footer was also not fully defined. You could correct this but making the footer a different color than the page. Also, be sure to include a header with an avatar or a photo of yourself! -->

        <p>I am a Business Information Technology graduate from Middlesex University also, a MSc Mental Health Nursing graduate from King's College London.
          <br>
          <br>
          I have a business and database background from my degree and decided to expand my reach by learning coding skills. I work with patients on day to day basis as well caring for their mental state and recovery. 
           <br>
           <br>
           Learning the coding and gaining new skills to improve myself and maybe have a change of profession. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I have previously had some experience working with SQL and ASP.NET for database. While working with Adobe Photoshop however, technology continue to change and advance.  
          <br>
          <br>
          Gathering information via survey and analysing informations to present any specfic presentation as need be. Learning to develop myself in new technologies and creating more chances to rebuild my IT skills. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Nevertheless I'm a complete rookie in web developement but I'm thrilled to become better at it.</p>
